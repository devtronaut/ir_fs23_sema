Murugan (Vikram Prabhu) is 'Police' Pandi's assistant and he gives the media an advertisement in which he persuades people to buy land from "his" company making many people persuaded from it. A billionaire wants to buy all the land and when he is about the to sign the papers, they find out that the land is actually a graveyard causing the billionaire to not buy the land any more. When they are in the bar drinking alcohol, a call comes on 'Police' Pandi's phone. Murugan answers it, thinking it was the broker, who sold them the land, but it was actually 'Vatti' Varadhan. Murugan talks to 'Vatti' Varadhan in foul language and when he ends the call, 'Police' Pandi tells them that it was actually 'Vatti' Varadhan. He moves to another table and asks a man there for some more wine. The whole group befriend the guy, who is unable to speak.
The next morning, they find themselves in 'Vatti' Varadhan's house, where it is just like jail. There are many people, who work there, because they couldn't give back the money they borrowed. They all end up working there, except for Murugan who saved 'Vatti' Varadhan, when a few men tried to kill him, causing him to become his supervisor,\. One day, a worker in there gets to go home revealing to the others that 'Chinnamma' lets some people go. When Murugan enquires about her to 'Police' Pandi, he tells him that she is 'Vatti' Varadhan's sister. Murugan then goes to her room and threatens her to let them go as well. But when he sees Yamuna/ 'Chinnamma' (Sri Divya), Murugan immediately falls for her. Murugan then starts wooing her, but Yamuna still doesn't accept him.
One day, Vatti arranges for his engagement and Murugan and Pandi start arranging everything. When the Iyar Swamji asks them to bring the bride, Murugan gets shocked seeing Yamuna as the bride. When'Police' Pandi asks 'Vatti' Varadhan's servants why they brought 'Vatti' Varadhan's sister, they revealed that she isn't his sister and is the woman 'Vatti' Varadhan has been waiting to marry.

He promises the men, that he will give 'Vatti' Varadhan the money that they borrowed and helps them. One day, Manickam dies and no one helps Yamuna to give 'Vatti' Varadhan the money that Manickam promised to give. 'Vatti' Varadhan gives her an idea by saying that if she marries him, she won't need to give the money. So, Yamuna reluctantly agrees. Murugan then asks if she needs any help, but Yamuna refuses and they separate. Somehow, 'Vatti' Varadhan finds them and he hits Murugan unconscious. He forcefully takes Yamuna with him and arranges their marriage. But the man, who is unable to speak, later revealed to actually be a terrorist, dies and their marriage stops.

		<field name="plot" boost="1.0">In a farm in Fernfield, Bartleby is celebrating his twelfth birthday with his grandpa. Budderball soon discovers an orange toy ring in his food, meaning that they now have all of the five toy rings of Inspiron. His grandpa then gives him a birthday present, issue 1 of the Captain Canine and Kid courageous comic books. Sam, Billy, Alice and Pete then arrive, dressed up as super heroes, with the other Buddies (also dressed up as super heroes) and the birthday party begins with a treasure hunt. As the Buddies hunt for the treasure they discover the area where the real rings of Inspiron crashed in 1985. The rings bond with the puppies and the Buddies wear them. Bartleby reads the comic book to his friends which explains the story of Commander Drex, Captain Megasis, how he turned into a dog on Earth and how the rings ended up on Earth. Rumour has it that the person who made the comic books based them on a real life event.
The Buddies then begin noticing that the rings have given them powers; Super strength, physic abilities, super speed, super elasticity and invisibility. The puppies, which Budderball dubbed "Super buddies", decided to use these new powers to help Fernfield and start by saving an ungrateful cat from a tree, but accidentally damaging sheriff Dan's police car. Jack and Captain Canine detect that the rings have been activated but believe it's a false alarm and need to double check it. Drex and his assistant, MONK-E, also detect the signal coming from Earth and prepare to head there. At night, the Buddies discover the candy store is being robbed by two robbers and use their powers to stop the criminals before sheriff Dan arrives and arrests them (after falsely arresting the owner and leaving him in handcuffs). A news crew arrives but don't believe what the owner says about the five "super puppies" while Sheriff Dan decided to take as much candy as possible. Jack realises this isn't a false alarm and that the signal is coming from Fernfield so Canine heads out to get them.
The next day, a building is on fire and a little girl is trapped inside. The Buddies go in to save her but Captain Canine comes in and rescues them. He then explains that these rings and the events in the comics are all real. Unfortunately, he cannot take the rings as they have already bonded with the puppies so he begins to train them how to protect themselves and each other. Drex lands in the farm and takes the shape of a pig, mistaking it for a human, much to the shock of Marvin. The "pig" steals a car and causes mayhem in town but sheriff Dan defeats him and takes him to jail. The kids discover the spaceship and see their puppies on the news, realising that the comics are real. They rush to find Sheriff Dan but Drex swaps bodies with him and he takes the kids hostage, demanding to know where the Buddies are.
Back at the farm, MONK-E decides to go out exploring while the super buddies face Drex. The kids, who are locked in the barn, look through the comics looking for a solution to this crisis. Working together, the Buddies defeat Drex however he soon begins to get the upper hand and kills captain Canine. He gives an ultimatum to the kids; surrender the rings or die. Drex then causes a meteor to head for Fernfield and Marvin tries to stop it. Bartleby hands over the plastic toy rings and Drex flies of in his warship. MONK-E decided to abandon his evil master but the meteor is already to close to Earth. Upon realising the rings are fake, Drex crashes into the meteor blowing it up. Jack reveals that using the full power of the rings captain Canine can be revived and the Buddies manage to bring him back to life. Without Drex, Captain Canine changes back to his original form, Megasis. A ship from Inspiron, which detected the rings activation and went out to find it, arrives with the princess of Inspiron aboard, who can finally marry Megasis after so long. They congratulate the kids, Jack and the Buddies on their success and takes the rings back to Inspiron with them.
The next day, outside the town hall, Jack announces his new comic book series to a crowd which he calls "Super Buddies" and his new partner, Bartleby Livingston. He reads the comic out loud to the audience. The film ends with a picture, from one of the new comics, of the Super Buddies standing on a building, ready for action.</field>

		<field name="plot" boost="1.0">Jaihind is the journey of five people, linked by one man, who fights for children's rights to education. Parvathi (Yuvina Parthavi), from a very poor family background, gets an admission into one of the most affluent schools in the city, but unable to pay the exorbitant fees, the man of the house sells one of his kidneys. They still fall short of a big chunk of money and they finally give up and commit suicide. This disturbs Abhimanyu (Arjun Sarja) deeply, and the computer service engineer becomes a hero over night, by propagandizing a solution for education costing so much. Abhimanyu suggests that all private schools be nationalised, which will compel them to offer services at very little fees compared to that being collected now, while still ensuring that the quality of education is not compromised. This is bad news for the private school owners, who make a business out of educating children. And hence Abhimanyu is targeted and pushed to extremes. He is put behind bars and is conspired to be murdered. How he succeeds in his mission, despite all this, forms the crux of the movie.</field>

		<field name="plot" boost="1.0">Following a grueling day of work, firefighter Jeremy Thomas Coleman and his co-workers contemplate ending the day with a case of 35-year-old Scotch. When Jeremy enters a convenience store to buy snacks, he witnesses the clerk and his son being brutally murdered at the hands of Hagan, an Aryan Brotherhood crime boss. After Jeremy narrowly escapes with his life, police detective Mike Cella, whose old partner was murdered by Hagan while they pursued him in a different case, sees an opportunity to bring justice. Hagan is arrested and Jeremy identifies him in a line up; however, Hagan demonstrates that he knows full well that Jeremy is behind the two-way mirror by reciting Jeremy's full name, address and social security number.
Prior to the trial, Jeremy is forced to change his last name to Douglas and surrender his entire career as he is placed into the witness protection program. Although Jeremy finds it difficult to cope with the loss of his career, he finds consolation in his budding romance with Talia Durham, a Deputy United States Marshal assigned to his case. Later, Hagan's attorney arranges for him to be released from prison in the weeks leading up to the trial. As a result, Jeremy and Talia find their lives in jeopardy. Talia is wounded by one of Hagan's hit men, and Hagan calls Jeremy, threatening to kill everyone he loves whether he testifies or not. Jeremy vows to kill Hagan first and abandons the witness protection program.
Jeremy travels home to Long Beach, California, where he seeks out an Eastside Crips leader to exact revenge. The Crips decline to help but give him a gun. Jeremy stakes out one of Hagan's hiding places and kills three of his men while in pursuit of Hagan. However, he leaves behind his fingerprints which can not be traced back to him due to his WITSEC status. The evidence, though, leads detective Cella to believe Jeremy is behind the killings. Jeremy grows bolder in his actions, torturing one of Hagan's men and confronting Hagan's attorney to find out where Hagan will be. Hagan's attorney, who only works for Hagan out of fear, gives Jeremy the location of an abandoned building Hagan will be at that night.
Talia arrives at Long Beach and tries to convince Jeremy to abandon his plan. Jeremy locks Talia in the bathroom and gets away, but Hagan's hit man arrives soon after and kidnaps Talia. That night, Jeremy, using his firefighting knowledge, sets ablaze the building where Hagan and his men are meeting. When Jeremy realizes Talia is also in the building, he puts on his fireman's suit and enters the building to rescue her. Talia manages to break free of her bonds and kills Hagan's hitman as he attempts to flee the blaze. Jeremy runs into Hagan inside the burning building and, after a struggle, Talia kills Hagan. Jeremy leaves the building with Talia. In the aftermath, detective Cella, while conversing with the DA, states that no evidence was left behind at the burnt building to charge anyone with the deaths of Hagan and his men. Cella is seen putting away a photo of him and his old partner.</field>

		<field name="plot" boost="1.0">While raiding Berk's Squab Farm, Mr. Fox and his wife Felicity trigger a fox trap and become caged. Felicity reveals to Fox that she is pregnant and pleads with him to find a safer job if they escape. Fox reluctantly agrees.
Two years later, the Foxes and their sullen son Ash are living in a hole. Fox, now a newspaper columnist, moves the family into a better home in the base of a tree, ignoring the warnings of his lawyer Badger about how dangerous the area is for foxes. The tree is located very close to facilities run by three farmers: Walter Boggis, Nathan Bunce, and Franklin Bean.
Soon after the Foxes move in, Felicity's nephew Kristofferson Silverfox comes to live with them, as his father has fallen ill with double pneumonia. Ash finds this situation intolerable; his soft-spoken cousin is apparently superior to him at almost everything, and everyone–including Fox and Ash's female fox friend, Agnes–is charmed by Kristofferson at Ash's expense. Longing for his days as a thief, Fox and his friend Kylie Opossum steal produce and poultry from the three farms.
Angered, the farmers decide to kill Fox. They camp out near his home. When Fox emerges, the farmers open fire, but only shoot off his tail. They then attempt to dig Fox out. After demolishing the site of the tree, the farmers discover the Foxes have dug an escape tunnel. Reasoning that the Foxes will have to surface for food and water eventually, the farmers wait at the tunnel mouth. Underground, Felicity is upset that Fox returned to his thieving ways. The group later encounters Badger and many other local animal residents whose homes have also been destroyed by the farmers. As the animals begin fearing starvation, Fox leads them on a digging expedition to tunnel to the three farms, robbing them clean.
While the other animals feast, Ash and Kristofferson begin to reconcile after Kristofferson defends Ash from a bully. The cousins return to Franklin's farm, intending to reclaim Mr. Fox's tail. When they are interrupted by the arrival of Franklin's wife, Ash escapes, but Kristofferson is captured. Discovering that Fox has stolen their produce, the farmers flood the animals' tunnel network with cider.
The flood forces the animals into the sewers, trapping them. Fox learns that the farmers plan to use Kristofferson to lure him into an ambush and heads to the surface to surrender, which would mean his demise. The animals are confronted by Rat, Franklin's security guard, who attacks Ash and Felicity. Hearing his son's cries, Fox returns and fights Rat in an electrical room until Fox pushes him into an electric generator, electrocuting him. Before dying, Rat confesses Kristofferson's location. Fox asks the farmers for a meeting in town near the sewer hub where he would surrender in exchange for Kristofferson's freedom. The farmers set up an ambush, but Fox and the others anticipate it and launch a counterattack.
Fox, Ash, and Kylie slip into Franklin's farm. Ash frees Kristofferson and braves enemy fire to release a rabid beagle named Spitz to keep the farmers at bay. The animals become accustomed to living in the sewers with others considering moving in. Ash and Kristofferson settle their differences and become good friends. Fox leads his family, Kylie, and Agnes to a drain opening built into the floor of a supermarket owned by the three farmers.
Celebrating their new food source and the news that Felicity is pregnant again, the animals dance.</field>

		<field name="plot" boost="1.0">Experienced CIA agent Ethan Renner (Kevin Costner), originally from Pittsburgh, works with a team to capture the Albino, lieutenant to an arms trafficker called the Wolf, as he is selling a dirty bomb to some terrorists in a hotel in Belgrade.[6] The Albino deduces the trap when he recognizes one of the agents (dressed as a chambermaid), whom he kills. Renner, suddenly dizzy as he pursues the Albino, only manages to cripple him by shooting him in the leg, then has a blackout, allowing the Albino to escape. Meanwhile, elite CIA assassin Vivi Delay (Amber Heard), a "Top Shelf agent", has been personally assigned by the Director to kill the Wolf. Vivi monitors the operation and suspects Renner has unknowingly seen the Wolf.
Renner is nearly disabled by an extreme cough, which is diagnosed as terminal brain cancer which has spread to his lungs. He is given only a few months to live, and will not see the next Christmas. For decades he has kept his dangerous career a carefully guarded secret from his wife Christine (Connie Nielsen) and daughter Zooey (Hailee Steinfeld), at the cost of losing them. He decides to spend his remaining time trying to fix his relationship with his estranged daughter, and if possible, his ex-wife. He returns to Paris, where he and his family live separately, to find the Réunion family of Jules is squatting in his apartment. He is told by the police that he is not permitted to evict indigent squatters until after the winter. He makes an awkward reconnection with Christine, and tells her of his terminal illness. She allows him to reconnect with Zooey, and when she has to go out of the country on business, she agrees to let him look after Zooey.
Vivi recruits him to find and kill the Wolf, in exchange for an experimental drug that could extend his life significantly. Renner reluctantly accepts, to get more time with his family. Vivi tells him the way to trap the Wolf is by getting the Albino, in turn by getting his accountant, in turn by kidnapping the gang's limousine driver. All the while Renner is fighting the hallucinogenic effect of the medicine, which occurs whenever his heart rate goes too high, and which he can only control by consuming alcohol. He must also deal with Zooey's school problems, including her habit of lying so she can sneak out partying. He manages to keep her out of trouble, and slowly reestablishes a father relationship with her, which impresses his wife.
He tracks the Wolf and the Albino into the subway, but they gain the upper hand when he is disabled by the hallucinations. The Albino attempts to kill him by pushing him in front of an oncoming train, but Renner manages to push the Albino on the track instead. The Wolf escapes, then contacts a business partner who can help him to flee the country.
The family is invited to a party thrown by Zooey's boyfriend's father, who happens to be the Wolf's business partner. Renner manages to protect Christine and Zooey, kill all the Wolf's men, and trap the Wolf in an elevator before breaking the cables, causing the cabin to free-fall to the ground. The Wolf survives, severely injured, but Renner is again disabled and, also feeling guilty for all the damage his work has done to his family, he's suddenly unable to pull the trigger, and drops his gun where the Wolf can get it. Vivi intervenes and kicks the gun back to Renner, telling him to finish the job and kill the Wolf, but he decides not to, because "I promised my wife I'd quit." Vivi then kills the Wolf.
At last retired, Renner survives to Christmas, which he is spending at a beach house with Zooey and Christine. He discovers a small, red wrapped gift package, which contains another vial of the cancer medicine. Vivi is seen on a hill behind the house smiling as Renner opens the package.</field>

		<field name="wikipage" boost="1.0">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaalpurush</field>
		<field name="plot" boost="1.0">The film tells the story in a non-linear fashion, with two timelines being depicted simultaneously. Rahul Bose has a dysfunctional marriage with Sameera Reddy who has an extra-marital affair.. Rahul tries to reconnect with his long-lost father (played by Mithun Chakraborty), while Sameera dreams of breaking free of her stifling domestic life. Rahul is considered as a failure both in professional and personal lives. However, an honest and simple man, he clings to simple joys of life and memories of his childhood. The back-and-forth movement of the story between two timelines (the present day and Rahul's childhood) and the arrangement of the sequences make Mithun a mystery man—he could be dead, alive, or, just a figment of Rahul's imagination.
The film begins as Mithun follows Rahul as the later returns home from a day's work. Rahul is shown to be a doting father, but a failed husband. Mithun then starts to tell his own story. He had a happy family with wife (Laboni Sarkar) and the adolescent son Sumanata. A past flame of Mithun, played by Sudipta Chakraborty, incidentally arrives in the village (as a part of a masked dance troup) and meets Mithun. At one unrestrained moment, she tries to seduce Mithun. Mithun tries to resist. However, Mithun's wife, Laboni, sees a glimpse of them in a compromising situation. Laboni, pained by the betrayal, decides to leave Mithun, with their son in tow. While a devastated Mithun becomes a footloose traveller, their son bears the scar for the rest of his life. Back to the present, father and son come face to face to heal old wounds.
Battling the brunts of a society that defines success too materialistically, Rahul also continues to relive his childhood memories. His wife, Sameera, meanwhile flies to the United States to spend an extended holiday with her brother's family settled there. She writes several travelogues. Rahul suddenly meets his father one day in a Calcutta street. He spends a memorable day with his father, reliving their memories, as well as discussing many aspects of life. Suddenly, Mithun disappears.
Rahul's wife returns from USA, and tells him that she has been in an extra-marital relationship for long, and their children are actually not fathered by Rahul. Rahul says he knows everything, and still love their children. Soon, Sameera leaves Rahul. Rahul continues to live with their children.
Towards the end of the film, Rahul again has a talk with his father, Mithun. Mithun tells him that many things in life remain unsaid, untouched. Mithun goes on to tell that after Mithun's wife, Laboni, left him, he wandered off to many places, finally one day, committing suicide. So, at the end, viewers understand that their suspicion was true that Mithun and all the talks between Rahul and Mithun were nothing but the imagination of Rahul's sensitive mind. Rahul continues to be a doting father.
The film has several fantasy-like characters appearing several times. The old flute-seller, Idrish, and his son, Abdul, are such a pair of characters. Rahul once met them in his childhood. However, the duo appears several times in the film, especially in the moments when there is a voice-over of Mithun, or when Rahul is reliving some old memories. Masked troupes of village dancers also make several appearances.</field>

		<field name="plot" boost="1.0">The film begins with the September 11 attacks shown on television when Ali Amir (Peyman Moaadi) enters a house and begins to perform salah when he is kidnapped and taken to Guantanamo Bay detention camp, specifically Camp Delta.
Eight years later, Army Private first-class Amy Cole (Kristen Stewart) is placed as a guard at Guantanamo. Upon arrival, she volunteers to the IRF and is cold towards the detainees, despite her contempt for the facility's handling of detainees. While on duty, Ali tries to make conversation, but Amy is annoyed by his persistence and rebuffs his advances; in return, Ali throws his feces at her and is sent to the frequent flyer program. Corporal "Randy" Ransdell also takes an interest in Amy, going as far as to attempt to have sex with her in a bathroom.
Amy enters Ali's cell while it is being searched and notices suicide-prevention pamphlets on the floor. She finds Ali's file, which reveals that he has a history of self-harm and discipline, becoming more and more violent as time passed. When Ali returns to his cell, he apologizes to Amy for his actions. He confides to her that he was born in Bremen, Germany and was not involved with terrorist groups, and a relationship forms between the two.
Eight months later, Ransdell lies to Amy and orders her to watch Ali shower, violating SOP and Arabic social norms. Upon discovering that Ransdell lied, Amy files a report to her commanding officer, Colonel James Drummond. Drummond talks to Ransdell, who makes (unspecified) counter-accusations, and dismisses Amy's complaint because Ransdell is her superior. Both enlisted must attend boards of inquiry (not shown nor later referred to). Amy begins to become more isolated from the other guards and is reassigned to the night shift.
One night, near the end of Amy's tour at Guantanamo, Ali takes a blade hidden in his Quran and tries to commit suicide, but is talked down by Amy, who tells him her name and where she's from (also violations of SOP). At this point, it is clear that her feelings towards the detainee have softened as she is distressed by the possibility of him dying. As Amy leaves Guantanamo teary-eyed, Ali discovers the Harry Potter book he had been hoping for over two years, finding she had written a note inside saying: "To Ali, I don't know if Snape's a good guy. But I know you are. Love, Blondie"</field>
