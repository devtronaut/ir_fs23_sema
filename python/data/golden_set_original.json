Ince, whose birthday is the reason for the weekend cruise, and his mistress, starlet Margaret Livingston; international film star Charlie Chaplin; English writer Elinor Glyn; and Louella Parsons, a film critic for Hearst's New York American.\r\nSeveral of those participating in the weekend's festivities are at a crossroads in their lives and\/or careers. Chaplin, still dealing with the critical and commercial failure of A Woman of Paris and rumors he has impregnated 16-year-old Lita Grey (who appeared in his film The Kid) is in the midst of preparing The Gold Rush. Davies longs to appear in a slapstick comedy rather than the somber costume dramas to which Hearst has kept her confined. Ince's eponymous film studio is in dire financial straits, so he hopes to convince Hearst to take him on as a partner in Cosmopolitan Pictures. Parsons would like to relocate from the East Coast to more glamorous Hollywood.\r\nHearst suspects Davies and Chaplin have engaged in an affair, a suspicion shared by Ince, who seeks proof he can present to Hearst in order to curry favor with him. In the wastepaper basket in Chaplin's stateroom, Ince discovers a discarded love letter to Davies and pockets it with plans to produce it at an opportune moment. When he finally does, Hearst is enraged. His anger is fueled further when he finds a brooch he had given Davies in Chaplin's cabin. Hearst concludes it was lost there during a romantic liaison, and he rifles Marion's room for further evidence.\r\nArmed with a pistol, Hearst searches the yacht for Chaplin in the middle of the night. Ince, meanwhile, runs into Davies and the two sit and talk with Ince donning a hat Chaplin had worn. Davies explains to Ince her love for Hearst and her regret at an earlier affair with Chaplin. She states \"I never loved him\" just as Hearst arrives behind them. Thinking Davies is referring to him, and mistaking Ince for Chaplin, a jealous Hearst shoots Ince. The assault is witnessed by Parsons, who had heard noises and went to investigate.\r\nHearst arranges to dock in San Diego and have a waiting ambulance take the dying Ince home. He phones the injured man's wife and tells her Ince attempted suicide when Livingston tried to end their affair, assuring her the truth won't reach the media. To the rest of his guests he announces Ince's ulcer flared up and required immediate medical attention. Davies, of course, knows the truth, and confides in Chaplin. Also armed with that knowledge is Parsons, who assures Hearst his secret will be safe in exchange for a lifetime contract with the Hearst Corporation, thus laying the groundwork for her lengthy career as one of Hollywood's most powerful gossip columnists.\r\nAfter seeing Ince off, Hearst confronts Davies and Chaplin. He is berated by Chaplin, who expects Davies to join him. Hearst, however, challenges Chaplin to guarantee Davies that he can promise her a happy life. When Chaplin fails to answer, Hearst informs Chaplin of the vow of silence he and the fellow guests have made to keep the weekend's activities a secret. Chaplin despairs as he realizes the murder has strengthened Davies' love for Hearst.\r\nThe film concludes with the guests leaving Ince's funeral, as Glyn relates what became of them:\r\nTom Ince was largely forgotten after the events of his death. Very few newspapers reported it, no police action was taken, and of all the people on board only one was ever questioned. It is concluded that in Hollywood, \"the place just off the coast of the planet Earth,\" no two accounts of the story are the same."},{"id":2,"release":2002,"title":"Like Mike","origin":"American","director":"John Schultz","cast":"Bow Wow, Morris Chestnut, Jonathan Lipnicki","genre":"comedy","wikipage":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Like_Mike","plot":"Calvin Cambridge and his two best friends, Murph and Reg Stevens, live in an orphanage.

Inside a thrift store donation box, Calvin finds a pair of old sneakers that were used by Michael Jordan.

Calvin is signed to a one-day contract by the Knights. Calvin prepares for his first game with the Knights, but realizes that he is not there to play. When the Knights play the San Antonio Spurs they start losing badly and Coach Wagner decides to let Calvin play in the fourth quarter.

Calvin brings teamwork to the Knights and makes them one of the best teams in the league.

After the game, Calvin bids poignant goodbyes to Tracy and Coach Wagner.\r\nAfter going back to his orphanage, Calvin is surprised by Tracy's return and intentions to adopt him. Calvin agrees under the condition that he also adopts Murph (whom Tracy previously met and bonded with), not wanting to leave him behind. Reg is later adopted by a different family, though they all still keep in touch. Bittleman is missing because he doesn't have enough money to pay the bet and the orphanage is now sponsored by the Knights."},{"id":3,"release":2004,"title":"The Phantom of the Opera","origin":"American","director":"Joel Schumacher","cast":"Gerard Butler, Emmy Rossum, Patrick Wilson","genre":"musical","wikipage":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/The_Phantom_of_the_Opera_(2004_film)","plot":"In 1919, the Op\u00e9ra Populaire holds a public auction to clear the theatre's vaults. Raoul, Viscount de Chagny purchases a papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 music box in the shape of a monkey and eyes it sadly as Madame Giry, an aged woman dressed in black, inspects him. The auctioneer then presents a shattered chandelier as the next item up for bid, claiming that it once played a key role in \"the strange affair of the Phantom of the Opera\". As it flickers to life and slowly ascends to its original place in the rafters, the auction is transported back in time to the year 1870.\r\nBack to this time, while the company rehearses for a performance of the grand opera Hannibal, manager Monsieur Lef\u00e8vre announces that he has decided to retire and that the opera has been purchased by Richard Firmin and Gilles Andr\u00e9, two men who have no experience with the arts whatsoever. When resident soprano Carlotta Giudicelli begins to sing for the managers, a backdrop collapses and causes everyone to blame the \"Opera Ghost\", a mysterious figure who is rumored to live in the catacombs beneath the theater. Carlotta refuses to sing and storms offstage, leaving Firmin and Andr\u00e9 no choice but to cancel the performance. At the last minute, ballet mistress Madame Giry suggests that dancer Christine Daa\u00e9 take Carlotta's place as she has been \"well taught.\" The managers reluctantly agree and, to their surprise, Christine wins them over.\r\nLater that night, after Christine's triumphant stage debut, she explains to Madame Giry's daughter, Meg, that she is being coached by a mysterious tutor who she refers to as the \"Angel of Music\"; a tutor who her late father said would teach her to sing. Christine returns to her dressing room to find Raoul, the opera's new patron and her former childhood sweetheart, waiting for her. The two reminisce about their youth as Christine tells Raoul her secret, only for him to laugh at her \"fantasy\" and invite her to dinner despite her protests. Unbeknownst to everyone, except Madame Giry, the Phantom of the Opera locks Christine in her dressing room and reveals himself in her mirror to her before hypnotizing her and taking her to his subterranean lair.\r\nThe Phantom reveals to her that he loves her and wants her to love him back. He shows Christine a bust of herself, wearing a wedding dress and veil, causing her to faint, and the Phantom places her in a bed. The next morning she awakes to find the Phantom writing music. She approaches him and removes his mask out of curiosity. He bursts into a fit of rage, covering his face with his hand. He at first says she must stay forever because she saw his deformities, revealing that he \"dreams of beauty\". Pitying him Christine hands him back his mask and the two have a moment of understanding. He then decides to return her to the opera house.\r\nThat morning, the two managers lament Christine's disappearance, as well as series of notes they received from the Opera Ghost trying to blackmail them for his payment and ordering them on how to run the opera house. When Carlotta returns, she is furious to find a note sent to her saying if she sang as the countess in Il Muto that night instead of Christine, then disaster \"beyond [their] imagination\" would occur. Firmin and Andr\u00e9 ignore the ghost's warnings and give Carlotta the lead role. That night, the Phantom interrupts the performance and criticizes their failure to follow his orders.\r\nCarlotta continues to sing, but her voice croaks (as a result of the Phantom tampering with her throat spray) and the lead role is given to Christine. While the ballet is being performed, the Phantom, not realizing the performance change, encounters the chief stagehand Joseph Buquet and strangles him before hanging him from above, creating chaos. Christine flees to the roof with Raoul. She reveals to him that she has seen the Phantom's face and fears him, but also pities him because of his sadness. Raoul tells Christine he loves her and will protect her forevermore. Christine returns his love, kissing him passionately and they both leave the roof. The Phantom, who witnessed the scene, becomes heartbroken. He then hears them both singing together. Growing furious at Raoul, he vows revenge on them both.\r\nThree months later, a masquerade party ensues in the opera house. At the party, Christine wears her new engagement ring from Raoul. The event is interrupted once again by the Phantom, who is dressed as Red Death. The Phantom brings his own composition, Don Juan Triumphant, and orders the managers to stage the opera. Raoul exits the room and Christine approaches the Phantom. At the sight of the engagement ring, the Phantom rips it from Christine and disappears into a trap on the floor. Raoul tries to follow him but is stopped by Madame Giry, who privately tells him the story of the Phantom's past. When she was a little girl, she went to a freak circus where they featured a deformed child in a cage. The child was beaten while everyone watched and laughed. The ringmaster then removed a burlap sack covering the child's face, revealing his deformity. Only the young Madame Giry pitied him. She was the last to leave and saw the child strangle the ringmaster with a rope. Chased by the police, Madame Giry helped him escape and found shelter for him beneath the opera house, where she has hidden him from the world ever since.\r\nChristine takes a carriage to visit her father's grave, but the Phantom secretly takes over the reins. Raoul follows when he realizes she's gone. Christine arrives and laments over her father's death. The Phantom tries to win her back by pretending to be her father's angel, but Raoul arrives and stops him. A sword fight ensues in the cemetery, where Raoul eventually disarms the Phantom and is about to kill him, but Christine pleads for him not to. His rage seemingly augmented, the Phantom watches angrily as Christine and Raoul ride away.\r\nChristine admits she is afraid of the Phantom and tells Raoul he will never stop trying to recapture her. Raoul realizes that they can use the Phantom's opera to capture him, as he will surely attend. Don Juan Triumphant is performed, and the Phantom makes his entrance (having secretly replaced the lead) with Christine. Raoul can do nothing but watch from his box as Christine falls for the Phantom yet again. However, she once again removes his mask, revealing his deformities to the entire audience, who scream in fear. He escapes with her by dropping the chandelier and setting the opera house on fire. An angry mob gathers in the opera house to hunt him.\r\nThe Phantom brings Christine back down to his lair. Madame Giry shows Raoul where the Phantom lives hopeful he can beat the mob and rescue Christine safely. The Phantom forces her to don the wedding dress and once again professes his love, and orders Christine to marry him. Christine tries to convince the Phantom that she does not fear his ugliness, but rather his anger and willingness to kill to get what he wants. Just then, Raoul enters the lair, and the Phantom ties him to a gate and threatens to kill him if Christine refuses to marry him. Christine reflects over the impossible choice before passionately kissing the Phantom to show him he is not alone in the world. The Phantom is shocked from experiencing real human love for the first time in his life. Ashamed of his murderous actions, and hearing the echo of the angry mob approaching his lair, he tells Christine and Raoul to immediately leave and orders them to never return. He finds comfort in a little monkey music box. Christine approaches the Phantom, who tells her that he loves her, and she silently gives him the diamond ring from her finger to remember her by. After Christine and Raoul leave, the Phantom smashes every mirror in his underground lair and disappears through a secret passage behind a velvet curtain just before the mob arrives. Upon entering, Meg finds only the Phantom's white mask.\r\nMoving back to 1919, the elderly Raoul visits Christine's gravesite and places the music box near her tombstone. He stands in silence for a moment and then turns to leave, but stops upon noticing a fresh red rose with a black ribbon tied around the stem with Christine's engagement ring attached to it; implying that the Phantom is alive, and still loves Christine."},{"id":4,"release":2001,"title":"In the Bedroom","origin":"American","director":"Todd Field","cast":"Tom Wilkinson, Sissy Spacek, Nick Stahl, Marisa Tomei","genre":"crime drama","wikipage":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/In_the_Bedroom","plot":"The film is set in the Mid-Coast town of Camden, Maine.
